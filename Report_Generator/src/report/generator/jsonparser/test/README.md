## Junit Setup with Eclipse

### Eclipse Setup:
- Install Eclipse or any Java IDE .
- Configure the JDK path by going to Environment Variables. Eg : JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202
- Once that's done, import the project that you cloned from git repo by following the below steps:
- In Eclipse, File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.
- Once the project has been imported, make sure Junit5 is already installed, else install it from https://junit.org/junit5/ .
- To include the junit5 jar, follow the steps similar to including gson jar as mentioned during the project setup.
- Once the junit5 jar has been included in your project, navigate to that test file and click run.
- The screenshots are available in the appendix section of FinalDocumentation.pdf.
