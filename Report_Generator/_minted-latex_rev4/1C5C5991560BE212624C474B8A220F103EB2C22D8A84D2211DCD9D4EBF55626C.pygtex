 /*In a pausable contract, buggyTransfer performs a token transfer but does not use Pausable\PYGZsq{}s whenNotPaused modifier. If the token admin/owner pauses the ERC20 contract to trigger an emergency stop, it will not apply to this function. This results in Txs transferring even in a paused state, which corrupts the contract balance state and affects recovery.*/
